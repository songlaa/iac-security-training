In a previous module in the CAS you created a (free Azure Account)[[text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account)].
If you have still some free credit on it we can use that to create an Azure Key Vault. The pricing for it you find [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/key-vault/):

## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Provision a Key Vault

This time the instructions are directly from Microsoft. Follow their tutorial [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/keys/quick-create-terraform?tabs=azure-cli).

You can authenticate through using the [azure cli](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli) which is in the Webshell.

If you want to do the training on your VM or laptop you need to download it as well.
